# Code Runner
How would you run user's code in a safe way? This application is my answer, code runner runs user's code in a containerized Lambda, preventing access to credentials or any other type of sensitive information. It simulates a challenge platform (HackerRank, Codewars, etc) where users write their solutions and have a service validating it against various test cases.
